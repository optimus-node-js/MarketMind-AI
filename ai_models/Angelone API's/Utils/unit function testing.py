# Example of usage
fetch_dates()



'''
Key Scenarios:
Saturday/Sunday:

Logic: Treat both days as if it's Friday.
Fetch data for Wednesday (from date) and Thursday (to date).
No time logic applies on these days since the market is closed.
Monday (Before 9:15 AM):

Logic: Treat Monday as Friday (i.e., consider the market hasn't opened yet).
Fetch data for Wednesday (from date) and Thursday (to date).
Reasoning: We haven't received Monday’s data yet, so we fetch the last two trading days.
Monday (After 9:15 AM):

Logic: The market is open, and we should fetch for Thursday (from date) and Friday (to date).
Reasoning: Monday’s data will start populating after the market opens.
Tuesday (Before 9:15 AM):

Logic: Treat Tuesday as Monday (since the market hasn’t opened).
Fetch data for Thursday (from date) and Friday (to date).
Tuesday (After 9:15 AM):

Logic: Fetch for Friday (from date) and Monday (to date).
Reasoning: We start receiving Monday’s data after the market opens.
Wednesday (Before 9:15 AM):

Logic: Treat Wednesday as Tuesday.
Fetch data for Friday (from date) and Monday (to date).
Wednesday (After 9:15 AM):

Logic: Fetch for Monday (from date) and Tuesday (to date).
Thursday (Before 9:15 AM):

Logic: Treat Thursday as Wednesday.
Fetch data for Monday (from date) and Tuesday (to date).
Thursday (After 9:15 AM):

Logic: Fetch for Tuesday (from date) and Wednesday (to date).
Friday (Before 9:15 AM):

Logic: Treat Friday as Thursday.
Fetch data for Tuesday (from date) and Wednesday (to date).

Friday (After 9:15 AM):
Logic: Fetch for Wednesday (from date) and Thursday (to date).
